# Husky Pre-commit Hook Configuration

This project is now configured with Husky to run lint checks before every commit, ensuring code quality and consistency.

## 🎯 What Was Configured

### **Husky Setup**

- ✅ Installed `husky` and `lint-staged` packages
- ✅ Initialized Husky with `npx husky init`
- ✅ Created pre-commit hook in `.husky/pre-commit`
- ✅ Added `prepare` script to package.json for automatic setup

### **Pre-commit Hook** (`.husky/pre-commit`)

```bash
npx lint-staged
```

### **Lint-staged Configuration** (package.json)

```json
{
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{vue,js,ts,jsx,tsx}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"],
    "*.{json,md,css,html}": ["prettier --write"]
  }
}
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### **On Every Commit:**

1. **Backup**: Creates a git stash backup of current state
2. **Lint Check**: Runs ESLint with `--fix` on staged files
3. **Format**: Runs Prettier on staged files
4. **Apply**: Applies any auto-fixes to the staged files
5. **Commit**: Proceeds with commit if all checks pass
6. **Revert**: Reverts changes and prevents commit if errors exist

### **File Processing:**

- **Vue/JS/TS files**: ESLint + Prettier
- **JSON/MD/CSS/HTML files**: Prettier only
- **Only staged files** are processed (efficient)

## ✅ Testing Results

### **Successful Commit Test:**

- ✅ Configuration files committed successfully
- ✅ ESLint ran and fixed issues automatically
- ✅ Prettier formatted files
- ✅ All checks passed

### **Failed Commit Test:**

- ✅ Created test file with intentional linting errors
- ✅ Pre-commit hook detected errors
- ✅ Commit was blocked
- ✅ Clear error messages displayed
- ✅ Original state was restored

## 🛡️ Benefits

1. **Code Quality**: Prevents commits with linting errors
2. **Consistency**: Ensures all code follows project standards
3. **Auto-fix**: Automatically fixes fixable issues
4. **Efficiency**: Only processes staged files
5. **Safety**: Backs up state before making changes
6. **Clear Feedback**: Shows exactly what needs to be fixed

## 📋 Available Commands

- `git commit` - Automatically runs pre-commit hooks
- `npx lint-staged` - Manually run lint-staged
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint on all files
- `npm run lint:fix` - Run ESLint with auto-fix
- `npm run format` - Format all files with Prettier

## 🔧 Configuration Files

- `.husky/pre-commit` - Pre-commit hook script
- `package.json` - Lint-staged configuration
- `eslint.config.js` - ESLint rules
- `.prettierrc.json` - Prettier formatting rules

## 🎉 Ready to Use

The pre-commit hook is now active and will run automatically on every commit. Developers can no longer accidentally commit code that doesn't meet the project's quality standards!
